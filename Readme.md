# Mesa Project Planning

This repo is an scratchpad space brainstorming ideas for how modeling might be built. This was used in the planning process of Mesa in order to set a goal for how we would like the structure of the model work.

The contents of this repo should not be considered of any value unless you contributing to Mesa.

### Directory descriptions

* referencecode are pre-mesa models, which are used as a reference for how a model might look in Python.
* dummycode are scratch .py files that proposed what a implementation of Mesa might look like.
